# Athletic-App
The homepage of an athletic app highlighting animation.

I really enjoyed making this app homepage. My inspiration was drawn from Garmin, Strava, and Apple watch with the colours, timing, icons, and interactions. I had some big ideas trying to make an app acting as a 75 hard Checklist, and while I achieved some of them, I could not get it to as polished of a place as I would have liked. To start, I made the home page following the black and blue colour scheme of Garmin. I then went on to make the four main pages of the app and how they interacted. Next, I made the icons into components that changed when the mouse hovered over them. Finally, I made the final page showing the completion of the daily goals set by the challenge using a wheel closing animation that is similar to the one found on Apple Watches. I had a lot of fun learning new interactions on Figma regarding transitions, timing, and components. If I had spent more time testing what timing felt right and what interactions felt organic, my app would have felt more realistic compared to the slightly choppy timing that it has now. One of my favourite parts was pushing how far I could take my mockup on Figma, and I found myself in a bit of a Figma YouTube wormhole, which unlocked even more stuff I could do. After Effects is quite intimidating to me. I watched a couple of videos on how to work it, but I am really looking forward to learning how to make crisper animations using After Effects and Figma.
