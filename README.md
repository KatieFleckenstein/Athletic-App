# Athletic-App
The homepage of an athletic app highlighting animation
I really enjoyed making this app homepage. My inspiration was drawn from Garmin, Strava, and Apple watch with the colours, timing, icons, and interactions. I had some big ideas trying to make an app acting as a 75 check list, and while I achieved some of them, I was not able to get it to as polished of a place as I would have liked. I had a lot of fun learning new interactions on figma with regards to transition, timing, and components, and I think that if I spent more time testing what timing felt right and what interactions felt organic, my app would have felt more realistic. One of my favourite parts was pushing how far I could take my mockup on figma and I found myself in a bit of a figma youtube wormhole which unlocked even more stuff I could do. After effects is quite intimidating to me, and I watched a couple of videos on how t owork it, but I am really looking forward to learning more
