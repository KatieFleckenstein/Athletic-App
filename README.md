# Athletic-App
The homepage of an athletic app highlighting animation.

I really enjoyed making this app homepage. My inspiration was drawn from Garmin, Strava, and Apple watch with the colours, timing, icons, and interactions. I had some big ideas trying to make an app acting as a 75 Checklist, and while I achieved some of them, I was not able to get it to as polished of a place as I would have liked. To start, I made the home page following the black and blue colour scheme of garmin. I then went on to make the four main pages of the app and how they interacted. Next, I went on to make the icons into components that changed when the mouse was hovering over them. Finally, I made the final page showing the completion of the daily goals set by the challenge. I had a lot of fun learning new interactions on Figma regarding transition, timing, and components. If I had spent more time testing what timing felt right and what interactions felt organic, my app would have felt more realistic. One of my favourite parts was pushing how far I could take my mockup on figma and I found myself in a bit of a figma youtube wormhole which unlocked even more stuff I could do. After Effects is quite intimidating to me, and I watched a couple of videos on how to work it, but I am really looking forward to learning how to make crisper animations using a combination of After Effects and Figma.
